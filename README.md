<h1>Active Directory Home Lab</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
In this project, I created an Active Directory Home Lab environment throught the use of Virtual Machines. Using Orcale VM VirtualBox, I created 2 VMs to host the Microsoft Server and a Microsoft client to configure my Active Directory Network. After setting up the network environment I ran a Powershell scrip to generate over 1000 users and logged into one of these users on my client VM, accessing the domain I set up in my Microsoft Server, that connects to the internet. This lab can simulate a business onboarding process which automatically creates a unique user access and resources to the business domain upon hiring.
